If access is tightly restricted and all users on the system have\naccess to all projects, this is not really much of an issue. If access is wider and allows login for users that do not have\naccess to any projects, or project access is restricted, there is a larger issue. If access is meant to be restricted and secrets,\nsensitive data, or intellectual property are exposed in Rundeck execution output and job data, the risk becomes much higher.\n\nThis vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.6"
